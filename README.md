# AproManager

AproManager is an Agile project management application built for managing software projects efficiently. It allows users to create boards, organize tasks into columns, add cards to represent tasks, collaborate with team members, track project progress, and visualize project status.

## Features

1. **User Authentication**: Users can sign up and login securely using Firebase Authentication.

2. **Board Management**: Users can create boards, both public and private, to organize their projects.

3. **Task Management**: Users can add cards to columns on a board to represent tasks.

4. **Collaboration**: Users can be added as members to cards, allowing them to stay updated on task progress.

5. **Archiving**: Cards can be archived when they are no longer relevant, removing them from the board view.

6. **Labels**: Users can add card labels to categorize tasks. They can edit label names, and colors, and create new labels.

7. **Due Dates and Reminders**: Cards can have due dates and reminder dates to ensure the timely completion of tasks.
